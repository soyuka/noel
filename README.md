Noël
====

Noël ([nɔɛl] - christmas in french).

## Context

Instead of offering a gift to everyone, it's fun to offer to some random member of your family (or friends).

Usually, you would just use sheets of paper in a hat and make them pick one! Though, distance might be a problem to search the hat so that secrecy is kept intact!

This script makes things easier and allows you to send emails with a unique choice.

## Usage

Just launch (debug mode is default):

```
node noel.js
```

Or more verbose:

```
node -v
```

## Configuration

Open `config.js` and edit the data!

## Launch

When you're ready to launch use (you won't know the pairs and email will be sent):

```
node nodel.js send
```
